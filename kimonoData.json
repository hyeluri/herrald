At our Hayes Valley Clinic, services are charged on a sliding-scale. Out-reach programs give free mental health care to children at two public elementary schools, to elders at the Bayview Hunter's Point Adult Day Health Center (ADHC) and to 'transitioning' foster youth enrolled in City College of San Francisco's Guardian Scholar's Program.\nJob Description: \nThe Development Manager is a highly organized and motivated individual with all the skills to manage Access Institute's development program that secures $350,000 each year from foundations, corporations, and individual sources The Development Manager works closely with the Executive Director, the Board of Directors and fundraising committees to provide leadership and support to all the fundraising activities of the organization.
