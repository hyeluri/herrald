We're a tech startup in downtown San Francisco looking for intelligent, conﬁdent sales people. Since graduating Y-Combinator three years ago we've reﬁned a SaaS product that is shifting the ﬁnancial industry and we're looking to bring on a handful of highly-talented teammates to help us continue our growth. Our target is small businesses, and we sell directly to the decision maker. If you want to help us grow America's small business economy, you're looking at an awesome opportunity.\nWe've nailed our sales model and the majority of our sales hires are kicking butt. You won't be doing cold-calling here -- you'll establish partnerships, write prospecting emails, get referrals from existing customers, and help us sort through our inbound leads. All calls are set via appointment only; one of the things our team loves most about working here.\nWhat we do:\nInside sales via phone/email: You'll need to be conﬁdent going toe-to-toe with C-Level executives. You'll need to be creatively persistent and subtly aggressive, because it's too easy to let a CEO walk right over you. Since you're selling to highly educated people, you'll need to have deft writing skills to match your verbal artistry.\nNetworking at tech/startup/ﬁnance events: If you don't genuinely ﬁnd these topics interesting you won't enjoy this job. If you do, welcome home.\nLearn: This point cannot be overstated. To be successful with us you're going to have to be learning every day; and not just for the ﬁrst few months. So if reading about business models or ﬁnancial strategies sounds like boring homework to you, this isn't the right ﬁt. But if you're into sifting through TechCrunch or learning about the startup-world, you'll love this as much as we do.\nIf you are interested in this role, please apply here:https://www.hireart.com/jobs/dbf219be/apply\nRequirements\nBare Minimums\n1-2 years successful inside-sales experience. Cold calling background preferred. Note that we will not consider candidates who have had zero sales experience.\nBachelor's degree from a solid university. 3.0 GPA minimum.\nThe Details\n$110k OTE (base + commission) with potential for increased earnings and promotion based on performance. Commission is uncapped.\nFull beneﬁts and unlimited vacation.\nCompany trips to Tahoe, Napa, etc. This job posting was written while all of us were on a weekend ski trip to Lake Tahoe.\nA group of people always looking for a good time: concerts on the weekends, Netﬂix marathons, TED events, hiking, etc... We hang out a lot after work, and we're looking for partners who want to be part of a close-knit group.\nIf you are interested in this role, please apply here:https://www.hireart.com/jobs/dbf219be/apply\nThis job post is run by HireArt.com.

          "text": "Engineering Team Lead\nCompany: Stitch Fix - www.stitchfix.com\nLocation: 731 Market St., San Francisco, CA 94103 OR Pittsburgh, PA\nThe Company:\nStitch Fix is the first ecommerce brand to blend proprietary technology, unique product and \nhuman-powered design to deliver a shopping experience that is truly personalized for our clients. \nFounded in 2011, we've grown from word-of-mouth and our leadership team includes former execs and \nengineers from Netflix, Polyvore, OPower, Baseline Ventures, and Uniqlo, among other \nleaders in the data and retailing fields. \nWe're building a Full Stack Startup to solve major challenges in ecommerce, apparel, \nmerchandising, client experience, personal styling, inventory management and logistics, \nand we're set to double our engineering team of 9 in the next year. \nIf you want to come build new products and solve interesting problems with a great group \nof people, we're looking for more excited and talented individuals to join us. \nMore about our engineering team:\nWe're working in a post-Agile process and are developing a distributed architecture of \nRails applications (no monorails here) that not only help our clients, but also improve \neverything we do at Stitch Fix. \nOur engineering and data science team is small, senior, and autonomous with no QA, product \nmanagers or project managers. We work with direct access to our clients and business data, \nand we communicate openly and transparently with the executive team.\nWe're working from San Francisco, Pittsburgh and remotely and we rely on collaborative \ncommunication and dev tools like GitHub, HipChat, Google Hangouts and Heroku to get it all done.\nThe Role: \nWe're looking for an awesome, smart, hardworking, creative, friendly, responsible \nEngineering Team Lead to help our engineers solve their problems as well as to add to our \nstrong culture of open communication and collaboration. You'll do things like architect, \nresearch, implement, and test our software; you'll lead a software engineering team; you'll \nteach and mentor other engineers. \nHere are some more specifics about what we're up to:\n* Advanced learning algorithms to aid our awesome styling team\n* Multiple-application architecture running in the cloud\n* Custom warehouse and inventory systems for a very unique business model\n* Responsive web interfaces to drive both the customer experience and our internal tools\n* Building prediction models for a smart and successful future\nWe build through open communication, collaboration, prototyping and testing. We work \nmostly in Rails with some Python. We love HipChat and Google Hangouts. We use new continuous \nintegration tools like Tddium to deploy to Heroku.\nOur Ideal Candidate:\nIs someone who's led or mentored an Agile engineering team before at a small startup - maybe \nyou were even a VP or CTO - where you also developed a couple solid applications using Ruby \non Rails and other MVC frameworks. \nYou come at issues from a product standpoint, and you get excited about product, company \nand business challenges. You learn what makes your team members excited and you help them \npursue those passions in their work.\nWe're especially looking for lead engineers who can demonstrate aptitude in the following skills:\n* Real tech fluency: You can build anything with anything, and you probably have 5+ years \nof software development experience with a couple of those years working in Ruby on Rails.\n* Communication skills: You aren't just great at listening, speaking and writing. You are \nable to convey complex ideas and information regardless of the medium or situation. \n* Product-Centric Thinking: You come from a tech background but you have opinions about how \nthe product you're building should work. You dig deep and work with customers, the company \nand our executive team to uncover the ideal way to leverage technology to solve problems.\n* Self-Directed: Once you've got something, we don't have to worry about it. You have a \nbias toward action. Our team doesn't have QA, project managers or product managers so we \ntake ownership of what we build.\n* Passion: You love what you do and can share side projects or open source contributions \nwith a GitHub repository, personal project page or blog.\n* Just Generally Awesome: You take your work seriously but not yourself. You show everyone \nrespect regardless of the circumstance. Extra points if we think you're funny or if you're \nalready a Stitch Fix superfan! \nBonus Points For:\n* Experience working collaboratively as a team. We use GitHub, Heroku and HipChat to get \nstuff done. We're agnostic about what you've used (and no judging if you're more into \nBitBucket) and are more interested in the process you like to use.\n* Experience working with testing and continuous integration. We're working with the usual \nRuby gems like Rspec, Capybara and others for unit and feature tests, Tddium for CI and \nRabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging.\n* Experience using pull requests to create rapid prototypes and new features. If we like \nwhat you make (and if you like what we're making), we agree to merge it to production!\n* Unique ways to automate and get things done. For example, if you've created a Ruby gem \nto complete a task in your projects, tell us about it! :)\nWe knew you'd ask eventually, so here's what we're offering:\n* Competitive salaries and generous equity.\n* A business that trusts and embraces tech. We know, a style brand? But it's totally true.\n* A senior team that does things right.\n* A startup with a proven business model that's growing fast.\n* Use your preference of tools and hardware.\n* A comprehensive health insurance plan, including full dental and vision coverage.\n* Fully stocked pantry with your choice of snacks and drinks. \n* Sunny office in downtown San Francisco, or similarly sunny office in downtown Pittsburgh \nstaffed with awesome friendly people! \nHow To Apply:\n* The Sourcery will be the first point of contact.\n* All applications receive a response.\n* All applications are kept strictly confidential.\n* To apply, click here."

Since we're handling the entire range of the Windows environment, efficiency is key. Given this, we rely heavily on scripting and automating tasks.

Back-end services like printing, Active Directory, anti-virus management, and drive encryption deployment also need upgrading, fixing, or just a little TLC from time to time.\nAll members of the team need to respond to more localized, end-user issues too. Whether the problem is a lost shortcut, an intermittent OS crash, slow network connections, authentication problems, or application hangs, it's our job to put things back in order. Our customers range across a lot of different groups in the Studio with a higher concentration in teams outside of film production. Some groups are very self-sufficient when it comes to handling computer issues on their own and speak fluently in geek, while others need a bit more attention and prefer communication in lay terms. The ability to effectively communicate technical issues to all of our customers is crucial.\nRequirements:\n-Experience administering Windows OS in an enterprise environment (studio environment experience a plus)\n-Experience with Active Directory replication, schema, diagnostics, and other core aspects\n-Good foundation and project experience with Windows shell scripting (.cmd, .bat) with the ability to script application deployments\n-Comfortable using Linux or Mac as it relates to cross-platform integration\n-Current experience with virtual machine software and technology\n-Experience with troubleshooting and debugging OS and application issues\n-Strong desire to automate everything\n-Ability to prioritize, respond to, and follow through on multiple, simultaneous requests of varying priority\n-Self-motivated when working alone or in a team with the ability to self-manage tasks and small projects\n-Excellent written and oral communication skills with the ability to effectively communicate highly-technical concepts in lay terms\n-Ability to work evenings and weekends as required\n-Ability to lift and manipulate objects (e.g. workstations and servers) weighing up to 35lbs\n-Experience with Python is preferred\n-Experience with WDS is preferred\n-Experience with Sysinternal tools is a plus\nIf you are a fit with most of what we've described here, please apply - we'd love to hear from you!",

This is an ideal opportunity for an experienced in-person IT Support Technician who thrives on helping people and developing solutions to technical problems.  You will be the sole IT Support Expert (with the ability to bring in consultants to help, as required) for an office of 40 that is growing, and will take care of users in the local office and remotely.   You'll need to be able to manage a few on-premise systems and manage multiple cloud-based applications.  Knowing how to keep things secure and help implement and maintain our existing security plan and roadmap are essential.

You'll need to make sure security is incorporated at all aspects of your work (e.g. strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, audit trails, data recovery, encryption, etc.).  Success in this role will mean excellent feedback from clients and exceeding client expectations.\nWe are looking for candidates who love working with and helping people, but who also loves managing technology.

        "body": "Are you an early riser with a sound routine? Do you have a regular sleep cycle? Contribute your healthy lifestyle to our research!\nThe SF Veterans Affairs Medical Center and University of California, San Francisco are conducting research in order to examine an investigational sleep medication. The study will be comparing the sleep medication to another medication that is currently available on the market. While many sleep aid prescriptions are effective at helping people fall asleep they can impair balance, attention and coordination if the sleeper is woken prematurely from rest and needs to function. The purpose of the RISE study is to examine whether this experimental sleep aid will help induce sleep without demonstrating these effects.\nTo evaluate the effects of this investigational medication, our research team is inviting healthy men and women ages 19-39 to participate in a 10 day research study. The study involves one week of at home self monitoring followed by a 3 night, 2 day stay at our clinic in the UCSF Medical Center. \nDuring the hospital stay, participants' sleep will be monitored by our sleep team's equipment. Participants are then asked to take one dose of a study medication during the day and remain awake for a series of games and tasks determining the medication's effects on thinking, attention and coordination. \nParticipants will be issued either the investigational medication, the non-investigational prescription sleep aid, or a placebo. Participants can earn up to $625 for their time and contribution. \nYou may be eligible if you:\n• Are between the ages of 19 and 39\n• Are in good physical health\n• Maintain consistent bedtimes and wake times\n• Have no difficulty falling or staying asleep\n• Maintain a healthy weight\n• Are a non-smoker\n• Have a valid SSN or Tax ID#\n• Meet additional study criteria\nEmail us at Rise.Study@ncire.org to learn more.",
